## Welcome to MineShaft
**TL;DR**
> We turn GameFi into OpenAI Gym compatible environment, contribute your computation power to train deep reinforcement learning agent.

And yes... You can use the MineShaft to mine cryptocurrencies through NFT Games too.

### An illustration
How will it be like? Remember of OpenAI Five? We mean to beat OpenAI Five.

### About
We are a group of Gamer, Cryptocurrency miner and AI researcher excited by OpenAI Five that fights world champion. An idea was born one day: AI that plays Thetan Arena with us and gain cryptocurrencies?

Project `MineShaft` aim to provide an OpenAI Gym compatible environment for reinforcement learning agent to play Thetan Arena. We will make it extensible to support other NFT games in the future. 🚀

In old days cryptocurrecy mining does not give much value but cost high power consumption. If we can take that cryptocurrecy reward as return of constribute computation power for training better reinforcement learning agent through NFT games? It will be balanced in mining cryptocurrecy and social responsibility. 💕

### Minestones
- 🌍 An environment for AI to play Thetan Arena
- 🚀 Training demo of AI playing Thetan Arena
- 🌔 Distributed training of AI on Thetan Arena with "miner nodes" connected to one MineShaft server
- 🌠 Inferencing of trained AI playing Thetan Arena to mine cryptocurrecy
- 👾 Public contribution of MineShaft supporting other games
<!-- - 🤖 Public contribution of "Miner" by developing new reinforcement learning agents (Project `Miner`, to be announced later) -->
<!-- - 📊 Official benchmark of AI models on each game -->
<!-- - 🏪 Marketplace for reinforcement learning agents in "Miner" for industrial robotics (revenue sharing with contributor) -->
